# Getting Started with Create React App ðŸš€

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts ðŸ“œ

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back! This command will remove the single build dependency and copy all configuration files and dependencies, allowing full control over the project setup.

## Deployment ðŸš€

Refer to the [Create React App Deployment Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for instructions on how to deploy your application.
